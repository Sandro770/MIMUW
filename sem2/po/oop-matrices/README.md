# Matrix representation

This project is all about adding and multiplying different types of matrices. There are a lot of memory/time optimizations implemented while multiplying special types of matrices.

The tests tests and following classes are external:  DoubleMatrixFactory, MatrixCellValue, IDoubleMatrix, but the rest was implemented by Alessandro Peria.
